Here there are some quick instructions to setup the a8 core:


First as usual, turn off the Chameleon, remove the SD card and disconnect it from the docking station.


You need to flash with Chaco these files:


NTSC Core (output resolution of 640x480pixels, 59Hz):

PAL Core (output resolution of 720x576 pixels, 50Hz):

http://www.scrameta.net/autobuild/YYYYMMDD/chameleon/build_PAL_VGA/output_files/atari800core.rbf 


I flashed the cores on Chaco's slots 14 and 15 (Chameleon’s 15 and 16).


Then you need to create these folders on the SD card:

(root)/atari800/rom/

(root)/atari800/user/


You have to download this file and unzip it:

And copy these files to the SD card:


System ROM:

(root)/atari800/rom/atarixl.rom

Basic:

(root)/atari800/rom/ataribas.rom


And finally you have to save your Atari games,etc. on the folder:

(root)/atari800/user/


Here you can see a list of games that have been tested on the a8 core:

From the instructions:


“When running Atari software a lot of programs need to have basic disable. Hold Option when pressing reset (F8)”  -> very important!


The core uses the joystick port 1 in the docking station.
